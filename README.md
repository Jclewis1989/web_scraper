# Web Scraper and Form Bot for www.mexicanautoinsurance.com

Fast solution for agents at Lewis and Lewis to quote Mexican Homeowners within several minutes, as opposed to 21 minutes per quote. Once an application
is received from a prospect, we launch the web scraper by passing the ID of the home quote to a form field, which will then load all the applicants data in a form for admin to edit
as they please. We run the clean data and load it into the companies website multi-step form passing values into fields based off of class and id selectors in the source code. When all done,
agents have a premium, broker fee and total cost of insurance to provide to the client.
